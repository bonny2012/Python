# Python
There are six projects according to the requirement of Artifical intelligenct course.

1. How to solve TSP with Brute Force Algorithm in Python
2. Comparison of shortest path problem with DFS, BFS and DIJKSTRA algorithms
3. Comparison of Running time for Greedy Search, Dijkstra Search and Brute Force Search about TSP 
4. Solving Travelling Sales Man problem with Genetic Algorithm
5. Comparison of Genetic Algorithm and Combination of GA and Wisdom of Crowds  
6. Solve Minimum k-cut problem with Hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Wisdom of Crowds
